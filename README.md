# PulsedLight

This project was able to successfully read LIDAR-Lite v2 sensors using a Raspberry Pi 3 and control a 3DR IRIS drone via DroneKit Python applications. 

In order to set up the system, please read the [set-up file](https://github.com/keikofujii/PulsedLight/blob/master/SetUp.pdf).

The final product is located in the [Final_Product_Code](https://github.com/keikofujii/PulsedLight/tree/master/Final_Product_Code) folder. 

The dev folder holds previous revisions of the product and is unneeded for the final product.
